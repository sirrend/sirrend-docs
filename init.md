# Init ðŸ‘‹ 

Init is used to initialize a Terrap workspace in a given directory.</br>
On execution, init runs `terraform init` under the hood and initializes the given context (directory)</br>

?> **Important!** Terrap decides which Terraform version to use **in the following order**:
</br>1. The latest installed Terraform version found locally.
</br>2. If the `TERRAP_TERRAFORM_VERSION` environment variable is set, Terrap will use the version specified as long as it matches the `>=0.13` constraint.
</br>3. If none of the above is applicable, Terrap will download the latest available version.

Init is necessary when you have a predefined set of providers and want to track changes made in subsequent versions.</br>
It is prefered to use `init` in most cases, to make the use of other commands easier.
