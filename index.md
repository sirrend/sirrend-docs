# How it works?

## FACTS
* Operational teams spend a significant amount their time on manual upgrades, updates, and maintenance tasks.
* These tasks due to security issues, new features, EOL or depracations.

## PROBLEM
* Existing tools merely signal the need for action, leaving the crucial mitigation process in human hands.
* Due to the involvement of humans hands, the actions are subject to mistakes and bugs.
* The time spent by operational teams is crucial, expensive and comes at the expense of business related tasks.

## SOLUTION
* Sirrend suite!
* Connect Sirrend tools for fixups to be implemented to the codebase with just a click of a button.
* We decrease the time spent on mitigation tasks sigificantly
